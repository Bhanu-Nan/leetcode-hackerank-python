 LeetCode + HackerRank DSA Grind (Python Edition)

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I’m sharpening my brain cells one Python problem at a time. This repo is my journey through the wild lands of **Data Structures and Algorithms**, tackling challenges from **LeetCode** and **HackerRank**.

If you're into problem solving, Python, or just like watching someone struggle in public — you're in the right place 😅

 What's Inside?

This repo is split by platform — clean and simple:
leetcode-hackerrank-python/
├── leetcode/ ← All my LeetCode solutions go here

├── hackerrank/ ← All my HackerRank solutions go here

└── README.md 

Each file inside those folders is a solution to a problem. I name them based on the actual problem name (with numbers if available), so it’s easy to search.
